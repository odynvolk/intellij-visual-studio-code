# intellij-visual-studio-code
My (IntelliJ) key bindings for MS Visual Studio Code. I haven't used any of JetBrains other IDE:s but I'm guessing the bindings are the same for PhpStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine etc.

# Usage
1. Open user keybindings file.
```
File -> Preferences -> Keyboard shortcuts
```
2. Copy text and paste.
3. Good luck!!
